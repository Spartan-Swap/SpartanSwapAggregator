Read-only (Static-call) contracts for DApps & data aggregators

### Utils

Like a multi-call contract in that its purpose is to batch together multiple calls into fewer external calls but with more specific use cases.
Initially intended as a simple project to reduce RPC calls counts required for the Spartan Protocol community DApp but will likely then serve as a basis for our own SpartanSwap DApp.
